Toradora! (2008)

Ryuji, a kind but intimidating boy, and Taiga, a fierce yet tiny girl, agree to help each other confess to their crushes. But as they spend time together, they realize their feelings might be for each other instead. A perfect mix of comedy, chaos, and heartfelt romance that grows naturally.
