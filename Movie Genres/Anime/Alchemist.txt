Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood

Two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, use forbidden alchemy to try to bring their mother back â€” and pay a terrible price. Their quest to restore what they lost takes them across a world filled with magic, war, and deep philosophical questions about sacrifice and power.
